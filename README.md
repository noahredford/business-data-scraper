# Google API Business Data Scraping

This Python script uses the Google Places API to collect business data, including business names, addresses, phone numbers, and more. It supports querying based on location and business types, making it a valuable tool for efficiently gathering business information.

## Features:
- Pulls data from the Google Places API
- Handles multiple query types (e.g., business type, location)
- Exports data to Excel or CSV for easy access and review
- Can be adapted for custom fields like emails, websites, etc.

## Use Case:

By pulling accurate business information, fire departments can streamline inspections and enhance data accuracy for their fire safety management systems.

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies using:
